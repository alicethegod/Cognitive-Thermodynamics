# Cognitive-Thermodynamics
This repository provides the full implementation for "Cognitive Thermodynamics," a first-principles theory of AI failure modes. It includes scripts to run the core experiment on model autophagy and to analyze the system's trajectory in the dual-entropy space (H_TSE, H_SIE), reproducing all figures and statistical analyses presented in the paper.
